# A word of precaution:
   - Running **Advanced optimization** breaks the start menu, taskbar and task manager<br>
   - Running **A1 tweaks** causes a sihost.exe error after booting and it might take around a minute to load into Windows.<br>
   Folders also cannot be accessed normally, so an alternative task manager, Run or NSudo is needed to navigate around the operating system.<br>
explorer.exe crashes and hangs frequently so it has to be restarted either manually or be terminated while using the programs mentioned above to open files and programs


## Quick Start

### Visual Studio 2022

1. **Open** `DARKSTARtool.sln` in Visual Studio 2022
2. **Right-click** project → **Publish**

4. **Click** Publish
5. **Find** your exe: `bin\Release\net8.0-windows\win-x64\publish\DARKSTARtool.exe`

## How to use
Place NSudo.exe in the same folder and run DARKSTARtool.exe as **Administrator**<br>
